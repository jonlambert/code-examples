# Numerical Aptitude Test Framework
This is a module taken from a Laravel project I've been prototyping. 
The aim of the software is to provide unlimited, auto-generating 
exams for users practising for their numerical aptitude tests. 

The models are using Eloquent, Laravel's ORM. 
 
You can view example usage of the classes in example.php.
